CSS Grids - 
CSS Grid Layout provides a two dimensional layout system, controlling layout in rows and columns.

Grid Terminologies : -

1. grid Lines - A grid is made up of lines, which run horizontally and vertically. If your grid has four columns, 
    it will have five column lines including the one after the last column.

2. Grid Grid Tracks - A track is the space between two grid lines. 
    A row track is between two row lines and a column track between two 
    column lines. When we create our grid we create these tracks by assigning a size to them.

3. Grid Cell - A grid cell is the smallest space on a grid defined by the intersection of row and column tracks. 
    It's just like a table cell or a cell in a spreadsheet.

     If you define a grid and don't place any of the items they will automatically be laid out one item into each defined grid cell.

4. Grid Area - Several grid cells together. Grid areas are created by causing an item to span over multiple tracks.

5. Grid Gap - A gutter or alley between tracks. For sizing purposes these act like a regular track. 
    You can't place content into a gap but you can span grid items across it.

6. Grid Container - The HTML element which has display: grid applied, 
    and therefore creates a new grid formatting context for the direct children.

7. Grid Items - A grid item is an item which is a direct child of the grid container.

8. Rows and Columns -
